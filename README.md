This code is set up as a "bookmarklet", which means all you need to do is create a bookmark and set the destination of the bookmark to the script.  You're done!

To do that:  (1) View the source of the script (in the /src folder).  (2)  Copy the contents of the script.  (3) Create a new bookmark, and in the place of the address, paste the code you copied from the script in step 2.  (4) Save.
